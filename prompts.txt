Promp_Fase1:
From the image i have just sent you i need to use a support threshold of 80% in order 
to decide which of the elements ("Faros de Xenon", "Alarma" and so on) go through and 
are going to be consider in the next step to start creating the candidates subsets. 
So in the image i have just sent you it is clear that i an identify the number of 
times each element appears, so how can i go through them all dividing the number 
of times they appear and dividing it by the amount of "sucesos"
that there are (there are 8) so that i get the percentages of the times they appear
for a subset of 8 elements and can discriminate which elements surpass the 0.5 threshold

Promp_Fase2:
Okey great lets continue on to the next step. In this next step i need you get
the candidate subsets that are going to form up to 4 dimmensions 
(because 4 elements passed the threshold). 

In case you do not know how this candidates subsets are formed, 
you need to start with the lowest dimmension possible other that K=1 and so 
for this dimmension and the follwing you need to have subsets in which the last 
element of the subset are different and the previous ones are exactly the same 
in order to combine them.

For example, for the dimmension k=2 we need to combine the subsets 
that passed the threshold in a way that the new subsets that are formed with 
to subsets of the k=1 dimmension have the last element different and the rest are the same.
In this dimmension because there are combinations of subsets of 1 elements you basically
need to have all possible combinations of the k=1 subsets .

But for the k=3 and so on you need to combine sets of k=2 o k=k-1 respectively
following the rules I told you so for example if we have {X,C} and {X,N} which
are from the k=2 dimmension then we can combine them because it follows the 
rules i mentioned obtaining anew subset of {X,C,N} for the dimmension k=3.

And for yout information the elements that passed the threshold were Faros de Xenon, 
Control de Velocidad, Navegador, Bluetooth.

Prompt_Fase3:
Okey great, thanks, lets move on to the next step, now we need to start working 
with tree structures, first you are going to focus on the candidates subsets, 
which first need to be transformed the words into numbers, using this transformation: 
{ Faros de Xenon =1, Control de Velocidad = 2, Navegador =3, Bluetooth =4, Techo Solar =5,
Alarma =6). Once you transform the candidates to the numbers, this numbers must be sorted, 
for example if you have a subset that ends up being 243, it has to trasform to 234.

Prompt_Fase4:
okey, so the next step is to transform all the elementos of the sample to the numbers
following this mapping function, so that as we have done for the candidate
 subsets we can transform the sample into trees of k=2, 3 and 4 dimmensions .

The way of getting the subsets of those dimmensions if basically combining all possible
 ways the values of the sample subsets so that you get subsets of size =2, 3 or 4. 
Another critical thing is that you need to have the numbers sorted ascendingly so 
if for example one subset is {2,3,1} it has to be {1,2,3} before it gets transformed 
to a tree. So with that being said, this is the mapping:
item_map <- c( + "Faros de Xenon" = 1, + "Control de Velocidad" = 2, + "Navegador" = 3,
+ "Bluetooth" = 4, + "Techo Solar" = 5, + "Alarma" = 6 + ) 

And this is sample that needs to be transformed first into numbers and then into subsets
of size = 2, 3 and 4 so that the trees of this samples are created:
muestra <- Matrix(c(1,1,1,1,0,0, 1,1,0,1,1,0, 1,1,1,0,0,0, 1,0,1,1,1,0, 1,1,0,1,0,0, 
0,0,1,0,0,0, 1,1,0,1,0,0, 0,0,0,0,1,1), nrow = 8, ncol = 6, byrow=TRUE, 
dimnames = list(c("suceso1", "suceso2", "suceso3", "suceso4", "suceso5", "suceso6", 
"suceso7", "suceso8"), c("Faros de Xenon", "Control de Velocidad", "Navegador", 
"Bluetooth", "Techo Solar", "Alarma")),sparse=TRUE).

The trees need to be done for every level for every subset of the sample.

Prompt_Fase5:
okey great, we can now move on to the next phase which consists on counting 
how many times do the leafs of the candidates tree in each level appear 
in each of the sample trees as this values need to be counted in order 
to see which of the candidates subsets move on to the next phase.

okey, great no that i have the supports for every tree subset, 
we need to filter by threshold that i have already defined previously 
support_threshold <- 0.5. The ones that pass the cut will pass on to 
the next phase.

Prompt_Fase6:
Okay, we can move onto the next phase, no we have to create associations 
from every level (L2, L3, L4) . The amount of associations that can be 
created for each subset of each level follows the following formula: 2^k-2. 
So for example for every subset of k=2, there are two possible associations. 

Before you start creating every association for each subset you have to reverse 
the numeric values for the words that we previously changed.

Prompt_Fase7:
so now we enter the last phase, we need to evaluate the confidence threshold 
for every association we created. In my case the confidence threshold will be of 
0.8 can you help me analyze this last phase for all the associations in every 
level please.

And also, do not incorporate prunning to the code.
